> An useful and simple set of SASS mixins.

[**Documentation**](https://github.com/filipelinhares/mussarela/wiki)

## Why?

I used bourbon for a while but it has many features I don't need while lacking some that I do. So I decided to build my own set of mixins.

## Installation

##### Vanilla way
1. Clone the repository
2. Extract the mussarela folder
3. Import it in your project `@import mussarela/mussarela`.

##### Bower
1. `bower install mussarela`
2. Import the mussarela file into your project

## Todo

#### Project
- [ ] Put into a gem
- [ ] Install with a CLI system

#### New Features
- [ ] [Deal with events](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/sass/simplifying-contexts-events)
- [ ] Deal with fonts
- [ ] Vertical rhythm
